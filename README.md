# Implement a Design with Bootstrap (Max's Version)
## RC Plane Shop Website

---

In this project, I have to create a website relating to a hobby of mine, using
Bootstrap. I can use minimal CSS, but it can't be structural (i.e. can't set
margins, but can change color). I must make at least 1-2 fully functional web
pages that utilize the wireframes provided with minimal instruction. This
project may be somewhat rushed, as I am falling behind on pace and starting to
get burnt out on coding.

For the hobby theme, I chose RC planes - more specifically, I am going to make
a shop website for RC planes and RC plane supplies. I might redesign HobbyTown's
website, or I might make my own thing. As I haven't started just yet, I haven't
decided which I will do yet.
