In this project, I have to create a website relating to a hobby of mine, using
Bootstrap. I can use minimal CSS, but it can't be structural (i.e. can't set
margins, but can change color). I must make at least 1-2 fully functional web
pages that utilize the wireframes provided with minimal instruction. This
project may be somewhat rushed, as I am falling behind on pace and starting to
get burnt out on coding.

For the hobby theme, I chose RC planes—more specifically, I am going to make
a shop website for RC planes and RC plane supplies.

# Tasks Sections Guide
[//]: # (Todo: "For each task, please include a guide in your ReadMe
          highlighting what section of your site should be graded. You dont
          need to have the sections in the order they are listed. You are also
          welcome to include more sections beyond what is listed!")

## 1. Header
The header contains the navbar at the top of every page. Everything in this task
is contained inside the `<header>` tag inside the body of all HTML files. The
styles for this task are in the top section of [styles.css](styles.css) under
the "Header Styles" comment.

The navbar has 4 nav items: Home, Shop, Categories, and Contact. The Home link
takes you to the main home page. The Shop link takes you to the Shop page. The
Categories link is a dropdown menu that takes you to 3 different sections on
the Shop page. The Contact link takes you to the Home page at a section about
contact info.
